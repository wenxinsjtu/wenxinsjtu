Hi, I'm Xin Wen (温昕), a current PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanghai Jiao Tong University working on applied partial differential equations, especially chemotaxis equations.

I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020, and my M.A. degree in Mathematics from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2021.

I'm interested in partial differential equations(especially parabolic ones), computational mathematics, quant and coding.

I'm currently learning analysis, PDE, numerical solution of PDE and quant.
